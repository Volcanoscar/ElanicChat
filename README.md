# Elanic Chat

See it live on [heroku](https://elanic.herokuapp.com/).

Rules:

1. On the top, there are 3 text inputs and a checkbox; the first one for product name, second for username and 3rd for time delay. The checkbox is for 'seller'. They are explained below. 
2. For a certain username and product name, with seller unchecked, you as the user start a chat with the seller.
3. If for the same username and product name, the seller checkbox is checked, you as the seller start a chat with the user.
4. If the time delay is set to a value 't', You will also see past messages upto t seconds before. For example if you send a message to the seller and then as the seller, if you were'nt online earlier, you can set the time delay to, say 10 seconds, and hence receive past messages upto 10 seconds earlier.
